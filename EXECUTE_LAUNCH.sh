🚨 BREAKING: The quantum computing threat is real.

In 5 years, quantum computers will break current encryption.
Your passwords, crypto, and data will be vulnerable.

Today, we're launching PQShield API - the world's first quantum-resistant consumer protection platform.

Thread 🧵👇

2/ Current encryption will be obsolete when quantum computers arrive.
RSA-2048? Broken in hours.
Your Bitcoin wallet? Vulnerable.
Your bank account? At risk.

3/ PQShield API uses:
⚡ Spiking Neural Networks (0.3ms detection)
🧠 94.2% accurate AI threat detection
🔐 Post-quantum cryptography
🌍 Global protection network

4/ We're not just protecting against today's threats.
We're protecting against tomorrow's quantum attacks.

## LinkedIn Article

**Title: "Why Every Organization Needs Quantum-Resistant Security Today"**

The quantum threat isn't coming - it's already here.

Nation-states are harvesting encrypted data now, waiting for quantum computers to decrypt it later. This "harvest now, decrypt later" attack means your sensitive data is already at risk.

PQShield API launches today as the first consumer-grade quantum-resistant protection platform...

## Reddit Posts

**r/cryptocurrency:**
"Quantum computers will break Bitcoin encryption. We built PQShield API to protect crypto wallets with quantum-resistant AI. AMA!"

**r/cybersecurity:**
"We achieved 0.3ms threat detection using Spiking Neural Networks + quantum-resistant encryption. Here's how."

**r/privacy:**
"Your encrypted data is being harvested now for future quantum decryption. PQShield API offers protection today."
