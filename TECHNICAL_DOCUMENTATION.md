The backend infrastructure combines Firebase's real-time capabilities with Cloudflare Workers for edge processing, creating a hybrid architecture that scales automatically based on demand.

## Neural Network Implementation

### Spiking Neural Networks (SNN)

The SNN implementation represents a significant advancement in real-time threat detection. Unlike traditional neural networks, SNNs process information through discrete spikes, mimicking biological neural systems. This approach provides several advantages for cybersecurity applications, including energy efficiency, temporal processing capabilities, and inherent noise resistance.

The SNN architecture processes incoming security data through multiple layers of spiking neurons, each trained to recognize specific threat patterns. The system can detect anomalies in network traffic, identify suspicious behavioral patterns, and classify threats with high accuracy. The spike-based computation allows for real-time processing of security events, making it ideal for live threat monitoring.

### Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

Complementing the SNN system, the ANN implementation provides robust classification capabilities for known threat patterns. The multi-layer perceptron architecture processes extracted features from URLs, IP addresses, files, and network traffic to determine threat levels and categories.

The ANN system employs ensemble methods, combining multiple models to improve accuracy and reduce false positives. Feature engineering pipelines extract relevant characteristics from input data, including statistical properties, structural patterns, and semantic content. The system continuously learns from new threat data, adapting to emerging attack vectors.

### Transformer Models

The integration of transformer-based models, specifically OpenAI's GPT-4, enables sophisticated natural language processing for threat analysis. This capability allows the system to analyze textual content, generate human-readable threat reports, and provide contextual security recommendations.

The transformer implementation processes security logs, email content, and web page text to identify phishing attempts, social engineering attacks, and other text-based threats. The model's attention mechanism enables it to focus on relevant security indicators while maintaining context across long sequences of data.

VirusTotal integration enables real-time malware detection and URL reputation checking, while AbuseIPDB provides IP address abuse history and reputation scoring. Shodan integration offers network vulnerability scanning and device fingerprinting capabilities.

These integrations are orchestrated through a unified threat intelligence engine that correlates data from multiple sources, applies machine learning algorithms to identify patterns, and generates risk scores based on weighted factors. The system maintains real-time feeds from these sources, ensuring that threat intelligence remains current and actionable.

### Vulnerability Assessment

The vulnerability assessment module provides comprehensive security evaluation capabilities for networks, applications, and systems. The CVE analysis component cross-references system configurations against known vulnerabilities, providing detailed risk assessments and remediation recommendations.

Configuration auditing capabilities examine system settings, network configurations, and application parameters to identify security misconfigurations. The compliance checking module evaluates systems against industry standards including GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2, and ISO27001, generating detailed compliance reports with gap analyses.

### Quantum Threat Analysis

The quantum threat analysis module addresses the emerging challenge of quantum computing threats to current cryptographic systems. The system evaluates cryptographic implementations, assesses key strengths, and provides recommendations for quantum-resistant alternatives.

The analysis includes evaluation of RSA, ECC, and AES implementations, assessment of key sizes and cryptographic parameters, and identification of quantum-vulnerable systems. The module provides migration planning assistance, helping organizations transition to post-quantum cryptographic algorithms before quantum computers become capable of breaking current encryption methods.

## Real-time Processing Infrastructure

### WebSocket Implementation

The real-time processing capabilities are built on a robust WebSocket infrastructure that maintains persistent connections with client applications. This enables live threat monitoring, instant alert delivery, and real-time dashboard updates without the overhead of continuous polling.

The WebSocket server implementation handles connection management, message routing, and load balancing across multiple edge locations. The system maintains connection state across server restarts and network interruptions, ensuring reliable real-time communication.

### Data Processing Pipeline

The data processing pipeline handles the ingestion, analysis, and storage of security data from multiple sources. The pipeline employs stream processing techniques to handle high-volume data flows while maintaining low latency for critical security events.

Data flows through multiple processing stages, including normalization, feature extraction, neural network analysis, and threat correlation. The pipeline scales horizontally to handle increased data volumes and can process millions of security events per hour while maintaining sub-second response times.

## Payment and Subscription Management

### Stripe Integration

The payment system integrates with Stripe to provide secure, PCI-compliant payment processing. The implementation supports multiple subscription tiers, usage-based billing, and automated invoice generation. The system tracks API usage, scan volumes, and feature utilization to ensure accurate billing.

Fraud detection capabilities monitor payment patterns and user behavior to identify potentially fraudulent activities. The system employs machine learning algorithms to detect unusual payment patterns and automatically flags suspicious transactions for review.

### Subscription Tiers

The platform offers three distinct subscription tiers designed to meet different organizational needs. The free tier provides basic functionality for individual users and small organizations, including limited scanning capabilities and standard threat intelligence access.

The professional tier expands capabilities significantly, offering increased scan volumes, advanced neural network features, real-time monitoring capabilities, and priority support. The enterprise tier provides unlimited access to all platform features, custom neural model development, dedicated infrastructure resources, and 24/7 support.

## API Architecture and Endpoints
